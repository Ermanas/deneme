# The The Golden Snitch Sniffer
This is a sample git project to learn git. 
This project uses multiple long-range ultrasonic sensors to finish and track
 an object flying in three-dimensional space. It displays the object's
 coordinates, speed and trajectory through a VR headset.

I've change this on the "trying-sth-new" branch.
